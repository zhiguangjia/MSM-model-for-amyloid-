# MSM-model-for-amyloid-
A MSM code perform simulation of extention of amyloid fibril. Spcifically, in each circle, a new monmer (Ab16-22) will release from the bulk solvent. It may succes form a new layer or return to bulk solvent.  The read transition matrix derived from MD simulation and produce a trajectory which is the state of the monomer as a fuction of time.
